Working on this project might not be too hard for me as I had prior experience in HTML, css and javascript. The step of development that took me the longest time is actually understanding how D3 works, e.g. the enter() update() and exit() mechanism. This step accounted for more time as I had previously never worked with SVG and drawing circles, lines directly onto the webpage and coding with the “enter() update() exit()” mechanism was not intuitive initially. After sometime, I got used to it and was able to complete the assignment. I started this project by reading and fully understand the specification before I jumped into coding and referring to the spec along the way.

I think there can be an optional lab section that familiarize the students with the technologies required for this project. This helps the students to get a better feeling of D3 and might be able to speed up the issue identified in paragraph 1.
